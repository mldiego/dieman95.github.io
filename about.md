  <h3> BIO </h3>
</div>

HOLA! My name is Diego Manzanas Lopez and I am a PhD candidate at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. 

I am a graduate student at Vanderbilt University and I am as passionate as skeptical of self-driving car technology.

I moved to the US for what I though it was going to be a 4-year experience, but guess what, it wasn't. I am pursuing my PhD in electrical engineering at Vanderbilt University. 

I have been playing tennis since I was 5, and exercising is my way to relax and disengage with work, classes and any other reserach related topic.
