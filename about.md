  Get to know me!
</div>

I am a graduate student at Vanderbilt University and I am as passionate as skeptical of self-driving car technology.

I moved to the US for what I though it was going to be a 4-year experience, but guess what, it wasn't. I am pursuing my PhD in electrical engineering at Vanderbilt University. 

I have been playing tennis since I was 5, and exercising is my way to relax and disengage with work, classes and any other reserach related topic.
