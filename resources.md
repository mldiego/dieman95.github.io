    <h2> Books </h2>
</div>

This a list of books organizez by topics, although some may follow into more than one category, I will add them only to one, the one that makes the most sense to me.

### AI 

You look like a thing and I love you - Janelle Shane

### Personal development

Not textbooks, but the How to win friends and influence people is a good one.

### Psycology

Range maybe? Not sure how to express this category yet. Books like thinking fast and slow, David and Goliath...

### History

Books like Patria, Sapiens...
